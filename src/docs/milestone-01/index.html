            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging. Our team struggled 
                to incorporate workouts into our daily routines and eat proper meals every day due to our busy 
                college-life schedule, so we decided to develop the application HabitForge to address the issues of 
                maintaining healthy habits. It is an all-in-one fitness and habit-tracking application aimed at helping 
                users take control of their health and wellness goals. Our target audience is anyone who wants to 
                prioritize their physical and mental health but struggles to do so due to a busy lifestyle. Whether 
                you're a busy college student, an office employee, or a stay-at-home parent, HabitForge is the best 
                tool for enabling a healthier lifestyle. The application includes features like scheduling their workout 
                plans, setting goals, tracking their progress, logging workouts and calorie intake, and even creating 
                customized meal plans. Additionally, HabitForge empowers users to build positive habits by habit streaks 
                by logging in everyday and setting up their workout plans and meals. They will also receive reminders 
                through notifications and email. 
                
                HabitForge strives to make it easier for users to prioritize their physical and mental health during 
                their hectic schedules. By logging in every day and setting up their workout plans and meals, users 
                can build momentum and stay motivated to achieve goals in health and wellness.

            <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            <p>
                Workout Scheduler: HabitForge's Workout Scheduler component is a crucial feature that allows users to 
                efficiently plan and organize their workout regimens. Users can input workout dates and activities using 
                a straightforward interface, allowing them to arrange their fitness regimen based on their preferences and 
                availability. This component includes functions for adding, editing, and deleting workouts, ensuring flexibility 
                and adaptability to changing schedules. By giving a visual representation of scheduled activities, users may

                wellness goals. This component allows users to set specific objectives, such as target weight, workout frequency, 
                or calorie intake, and track their progress over time. The Goal Tracker dynamically updates users on their progress 
                toward selected goals, providing insights and feedback to help them make informed decisions and alter their behavior. 
                Users obtain a clear knowledge of their successes through visual representations such as progress bars or charts, 
                which enables them to stay focused and dedicated to their goals.

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                    The first type of data handled by our application is demographic information, which acts as the foundation of the user profile 
                database. Each user profile contains demographic information such as age, gender, height, and weight, which provides useful 
                insights into individual traits and needs for personalized health management. This data enables us to obtain a full picture of
                the user's physical condition and adjust the application's features to their individual requirements, resulting in a more effective
                and personalized user experience.
                    The second category of data is health-related data points, which play an important part in designing the user's health 
                journey in HabitForge. These data points, which include fitness goals, dietary limitations, and medical issues, are saved in 
                the user profile database. Such information enables the program to provide customized recommendations and features that are 
                relevant to the user's specific health goals. For example, if a user has specified dietary limitations, the program can offer 
                meals that comply to these constraints, ensuring that their health objectives and preferences are met.
                    The third type of data encompasses historical data, which enriches the user profile with insights derived from past behaviors
                and activities. Within the user profiles, historical data such as workout logs, meal records, and progress tracking metrics are stored.
                This historical data enables longitudinal analysis and trend identification, allowing the application to recognize patterns in the
                user's behavior and offer personalized recommendations for optimizing their health and wellness journey. By leveraging historical data, 
                HabitForge empowers users to reflect on their past achievements and make informed decisions to drive future progress effectively.
                    The fourth piece of data focuses on user preferences, which help to improve the user experience and engagement with HabitForge. 
                User options include preferred workout hours, favored foods, and desired health objectives. Understanding and adapting these preferences
                allows the application to provide a more personalized and engaging user experience, resulting in increased user satisfaction and adherence 
                to healthy habits. HabitForge uses user preferences to increase engagement and desire to achieve health and wellness goals, whether it's 
                scheduling workouts at appropriate times or recommending meals based on personal preferences.
                    In conclusion, the aggregation and analysis of user profile data within HabitForge represent a fundamental aspect of delivering 
                personalized and impactful health and wellness experiences. By leveraging demographic information, health-related data points, historical 
                data, and user preferences, the application aims to empower users to make informed decisions and achieve sustainable lifestyle changes. 
                Through the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive user profile database, HabitForge demonstrates its commitment to addressing 
                real-world health challenges by providing accessible and actionable information to users, ultimately promoting a healthier and happier 
                community.

                Every year, an individual is asked the question, "What is your New Year's Resolution?" and their response is either "staying healthy" or "going to the gym". Gyms will witness a membership surge in the next few days as people eagerly commit to healthier lifestyles. However, within a few weeks, the enthusiasm wanes, and gym attendance drops. Why? Either individuals need more motivation to go to the gym or are too busy and need to see if they can meet their fitness goals. This is where HabitForge comes in. 
                Our team has developed a application that goes beyond the standard fitness apps. It's designed to help you create sustainable habits for staying healthy and fit.

                Consider Justin, a college student in the Computer Science program whose resolution is to hit the gym every day. Initially, he's motivated, attending classes and workouts regularly. However, as work demands increase and his extracurricular activities increase, Justin finds it challenging to prioritize gym sessions. Without external support or a structured routine, he gradually loses momentum, eventually abandoning his fitness goals altogether.
                By offering tailored workout plans, progress tracking, and motivational reminders in our application. Justin receives encouragement when he achieves milestones and gentle nudges when he veers off track. He also customizes the meal so he is eating healthy food and not noodles cup. Additionally, the app suggests alternative workout options to accommodate his busy schedule, ensuring he stays engaged and committed to her fitness journey. From there, he builds his habit of keeping on track, ensuring he doesn't lose his streak and eventually achieves his fitness goal. 
            </p>

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The project, a fitness tracker app, is a direct reflection of the integrative 
                experience requirements of my coursework and personal interests. Throughout my
                university education, I have engaged in a variety of courses that have collectively 
                contributed to the development of this app. Specifically, my involvement in CS326, CS220 
                has been instrumental in honing my skills in software development and project management.
                This app is not only a culmination of my academic pursuits but also an embodiment of my personal growth 
                in the realm of health and fitness. It integrates my passion for technology with my commitment to promoting 
                a healthy lifestyle. By developing this fitness tracker, I will be able to apply the theoretical knowledge 
                gained from my computer science courses to create a practical tool that can have a positive impact on 
                individuals' well-being. This project represents the synthesis of my educational journey,
                where I have learned to leverage technology to address real-world challenges and enhance the quality of life.
