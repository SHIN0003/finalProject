            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging. Our team struggled to incorporate workouts into our daily routines and eat proper meals every day due to our busy college-life schedule, so we decided to develop the application HabitForge to address the issues of maintaining healthy habits. It is an all-in-one fitness and habit-tracking application aimed at helping users take control of their health and wellness goals. Our target audience is anyone who wants to prioritize their physical and mental health but struggles to do so due to a busy lifestyle. Whether you're a busy college student, an office employee, or a stay-at-home parent, HabitForge is the best tool for enabling a healthier lifestyle. The application includes features like scheduling their workout plans, setting goals, tracking their progress, logging workouts and calorie intake, and even creating customized meal plans. Additionally, HabitForge empowers users to build positive habits by habit streaks by logging in everyday and setting up their workout plans and meals. They will also receive reminders through notifications and email. 
HabitForge strives to make it easier for users to prioritize their physical and mental health during their hectic schedules. By logging in every day and setting up their workout plans and meals, users can build momentum and stay motivated to achieve goals in health and wellness.
