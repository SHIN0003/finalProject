            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging. Our team struggled 
                to incorporate workouts into our daily routines and eat proper meals every day due to our busy 
                college-life schedule, so we decided to develop the application HabitForge to address the issues of 
                maintaining healthy habits. It is an all-in-one fitness and habit-tracking application aimed at helping 
                users take control of their health and wellness goals. Our target audience is anyone who wants to 
                prioritize their physical and mental health but struggles to do so due to a busy lifestyle. Whether 
                you're a busy college student, an office employee, or a stay-at-home parent, HabitForge is the best 
                tool for enabling a healthier lifestyle. The application includes features like scheduling their workout 
                plans, setting goals, tracking their progress, logging workouts and calorie intake, and even creating 
                customized meal plans. Additionally, HabitForge empowers users to build positive habits by habit streaks 
                by logging in everyday and setting up their workout plans and meals. They will also receive reminders 
                through notifications and email. 
                
                HabitForge strives to make it easier for users to prioritize their physical and mental health during 
                their hectic schedules. By logging in every day and setting up their workout plans and meals, users 
                can build momentum and stay motivated to achieve goals in health and wellness.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The project, a fitness tracker app, is a direct reflection of the integrative 
                experience requirements of my coursework and personal interests. Throughout my
                university education, I have engaged in a variety of courses that have collectively 
                contributed to the development of this app. Specifically, my involvement in CS326, CS220 
                has been instrumental in honing my skills in software development and project management.
                This app is not only a culmination of my academic pursuits but also an embodiment of my personal growth 
                in the realm of health and fitness. It integrates my passion for technology with my commitment to promoting 
                a healthy lifestyle. By developing this fitness tracker, I will be able to apply the theoretical knowledge 
                gained from my computer science courses to create a practical tool that can have a positive impact on 
                individuals' well-being. This project represents the synthesis of my educational journey,
                where I have learned to leverage technology to address real-world challenges and enhance the quality of life.
